        <p>You are designing an application. You opt for one of two scenarios. In the first, code is repeated and logic duplicated when and where it's needed. There is some reuse of code, but it's random. In the second, each piece of knowledge is written only once, and then implemented from its source.</p>

        <p>You choose the second.</p>

        <p>Why do you choose the second? Because it is smarter. When you need to change, update, or extend your code in the future, this means you only have to make changes to each relevant piece of logic in one spot, rather than hunting it down and changing it all over the place &mdash; fewer bugs, less maintenance. It also makes your code more modular ("Cool! I can reuse that over here...") and more orthogonal ("When I change something over here, nothing else breaks.") This concept is essentially what Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas popularized under the D.R.Y. acronym &mdash; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself">"Don't Repeat Yourself."</a></p>

        <p>Another complementary idea is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle">Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)</a>, which suggests that each class or method should have a single responsibility. This promotes modularity further, since we aren't faced with dissecting simple behaviors out of more complex chunks of behavior when we want to reuse them.</p>

        <p>Last before we get to the heart of our subject matter is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Demeter">Law of Demeter (LoD)</a>. It came out of Northeastern University (my alma mater!) back in the late '80s, and basically promotes loose coupling. I like to think of it as the "Law of Making Your Code Run Like An Intelligence Agency," since it holds that units of code should know as little as possible about other units of code, communicate on a need-to-know basis only, and not talk to units of code that they have no business talking to. This prevents bugs and other problems from arising by minimizing illogical or promiscuous dependencies (entanglements) in your code.</p>

        <p>Great! We are now ready to start introducing our subject matter. Please go ahead and keep this stuff in the back of your mind &mdash; we'll tie it in as we go.</p>

        <p>Inheritance and composition are two Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts that support the reuse of code. Inheritance creates relationships described in terms of "is-a," as in <code>Ocelot</code> "is-a" <code>Cat</code>. Composition creates relationships articulated in terms of "has-a," which are much more flexible than ones forged through inheritance. However, since inheritance is the easier one to explain, we'll start there.</p>

        <pre><code>
class Cat
  attr_reader :what_am_i

  def initialize
    @what_am_i = "I'm a cat."
  end

end

class Ocelot < Cat
end
        </code></pre>
        <p>The benefit of inheritance is that it decreases redundancy in code by allowing child classes to inherit common general, abstract behaviors from a parent class. We may never want to directly create an instance of <code>Cat</code>, so it remains an abstract holding area for behaviors that would be useful for any class that "is-a" <code>Cat</code> to inherit. Since <code>Ocelot</code> "is-a" <code>Cat</code>, it inherits access to all the code within <code>Cat</code>.</p>

        <pre><code>
tufted_ears = Ocelot.new
tufted_ears.what_am_i

=> "I'm a cat."
        </code></pre>

        <p>Another useful benefit of inheritance is that children classes can override methods from the parent class, or change them to make them more specialized. Take a look again below:</p>

        <pre><code>
class Cat
  def what_am_i?
    "I'm a cat."
  end
end

class Ocelot < Cat
  def what_am_i?
    super + "..or more specifically, an ocelot."
  end
end

generic = Cat.new
tufted_ears = Ocelot.new

generic.what_am_i?
=> "I'm a cat."

tufted_ears.what_am_i?
=> "I'm a cat...or more specifically, an ocelot."
        </code></pre>
        <p>Inheritance is D.R.Y. since it cuts down on redundant code and helps keep classes modular...and I suppose it can be pretty effective in conjunction with Single Responsibility Principle...but what about the Law of Making Your Code Run Like An Intelligence Agency (LoD)? So long as the "is-a" relationship remains true, inheritance is fine; the need-to-know basis is real because the child classes are specialized extensions of the parent class. However, the minute this starts to change, red flags should go up. Many smarter and more experienced voices will tell you that as projects develop, classes that started out seemingly sharing an "is-a" relationship eventually diverge enough where that sort of relationship doesn't really make sense any more...and becomes an ungainly burden. It's situations like those that make them prefer composition over inheritance.</p>

        <p>Whereas inheritance involves giving one class complete and immediate knowledge of another class, composition does not. Instead, it uses classes or modules directly in order to accomplish what it needs. It is best served with an example, so let's use composition such that <code>Ocelot</code> "has-a" <code>Cat</code>.</p>

        <pre><code>
class Cat
  def identity
    "Cat"
  end

  def purr
    "purrr"
  end
end

class Ocelot
  def initialize
    @cat = Cat.new
  end

  def i_have_a
    @cat.identity
  end

  def make_sound
    @cat.purr
  end
end

little_spots = Ocelot.new
little_spots.i_have_a
=> "Cat"

little_spots.make_sound
=> "purrr"
        </code></pre>
        <p>As you can see, Ocelot initializes an instance of <code>Cat</code> and uses it directly by storing it in an instance variable. This way, the class does not have immediate knowledge or access to all methods of <code>Cat</code>...only the ones that we call on the instance variable, and then only from within methods of <code>Ocelot</code>. So <code>little_spots.identity</code> will throw an error because <code>Ocelot</code> did not inherit from <code>Cat</code>, it just uses an instance of it. See how this is much more of a need-to-know basis? It decouples the two classes much more than inheritance does, while also providing sharing of specific, relevant behaviors. This flexibility is what makes composition an oft-preferred alternative to inheritance.</p>

        <p>There we have it. I won't go into it here, but using Modules is also composition. And, while inheritance is cool, initially convenient, and sometimes totally appropriate, I think the answer to our title is that composition is my code-sharing favorite.</p>

        <p>As always, beware of sweeping declarations and the like &mdash; and be sure to consider inheritance and composition for yourself. I will continue to do the same.</p>

        <p>Hope this was helpful, and thanks for reading!</p>
