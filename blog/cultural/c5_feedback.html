      <h2>Pair programming and giving feedback</h2>

        <hr>
        <p>When I was in Guatemala, I got my open water SCUBA certification in a volcanic lake at relatively high altitude. Among other things, this meant that it was much more difficult to control my bouyancy than it would have been at sea level. Controlling one's bouyancy is a skill intimately tied to safety in SCUBA (probably the most important one after "never stop breathing!") and is also a good indicator of one's level of expertise. In any case, by the time I did my first ocean dive, my bouyancy control still needed polishing...but it was also leaps ahead of where it should have been, according to my instructor. Learning in the lake wasn't glamorous, and it felt a bit awkward at times - but my skill was much more fine-tuned than it would have been if I had learned at sea level, where conditions are more forgiving.</p>
        <p>Pair programming during Phase 0 feels a bit like learning to dive at altitude. It's not as easy as it will be in person, and at first it might even feel a bit cumbersome; but practicing now will make it that much easier when we get to camp and are pairing face-to-face.</p>
        <p>That is not to say that pairing has been difficult. If anything, it has been an interesting learning experience in how to work together efficiently, and an exercise in rapidly adapting to different dynamics. No two pairing sessions have been alike. However, there are a lot of common themes that arise.</p>
        <p>For one, it can take a lot longer to work through a problem with someone than it does alone. This is just a fact. While working alone, you can quickly check out any new approach that pops into your head without any attached debate or worry about offending anyone. On the other hand, there is no chance to learn new approaches, diversify your perspective, pick up new tricks, or teach others your own. So, while I could see pairing being frustrating at times, I think it's an invaluable practice that allows us to help elevate each other as a group and cross-pollinate great ideas. No one person has all the answers, and pairing ensures that ideas get spread and evaluated by a lot of different perspectives. This is super cool.</p>
        <p>It is also really fun. Sharing a new trick that will end up saving someone else loads of time is a great feeling, as is following up with people after a pairing, or learning a new method from a clever piece of code that someone else has written.</p>
        <p>So has it been frustrating at all? Not really, to be honest. At times there have been circumstantial aspects of a pairing that could be frustrating, but I tend to let them slide. For example, if my partner is having a bad day and starts letting their frustration show, it might bother me a bit, but I know that it is bound to happen to everyone sometimes. In instances like that, I just take it as a challenge to help navigate us back to a more productive track.</p>
        <p>It could also be frustrating when something takes much longer than it would take to solve alone, but I figure that is why we are practicing - to learn the balances of working together so that work gets done efficiently and in a way that complements both teammates.</p>
        <p>What about receiving feedback? For the most part, feedback I have received has been positive and encouraging. That just makes me want to continue trying to become a better pair! I want to be someone that people like to work with. For the same reason, I feel a lost opportunity when people don't offer any specific actionable advice. I would prefer that someone dig and say "that one thing that they almost didn't mention because it didn't seem like a big deal." Improving is important to me, and I think there is always something to be learned from any given experience. Critical feedback is personal, but that's okay - the type of feedback we are giving each other is to help each other in the long run, not hurt each other.</p>
        <p>That's why I always try to write actionable feedback, even if I have to dig or am tempted to just say "well done." I don't like criticizing other people, but I don't really see it as mere criticism, either. Like I said, I figure we are all just trying to help each other get better. By thinking hard to come up with something actionable, I am trying to respect the person I am giving feedback to.</p>
        <p>Granted, the most difficult part of writing feedback is that it really is personal. All I can do is hope that it is received under the assumption that it is offered with good intent. That is the same spirit in which I receive my own feedback.</p>
        <p>One thing I recently have needed to improve on is being mindful of the time while pairing. It's easy to forget the time, and perhaps timeboxing while pairing could be something new to try.</p>
        <p>To wrap up, I would say that pairing so far has been a very positive challenge. Different from writing reflections, pairing forces us to articulate our thought processes in the moment. It also allows us to continously sharpen our empathetic and clear-communication skills.</p>
        <p>Since a significant part of our lives is spent at work interacting with others, the better we can get at making these interactions positive for everyone, the more effective and desirable we will be in the workforce. Plus, it's also just plain fun (and really energizing) to have consistently good interactions with others. Looking forward to lots more partner programming in the future.</p>
