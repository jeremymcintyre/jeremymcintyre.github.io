        <p>Health. Vibrancy. Personal Development. </p>

        <p>These three have been present whenever I've been happiest, proudest, and most satisfied in life. They're a bit like the heads of three separate pyramids, each one standing atop a pile of other important values they encapsulate for me.</p>

        <p>Health is like a foundation for all other aspects of life. When I am healthy, I have greater harmony between mind and body, and am able to enjoy and accomplish more than when my health is compromised. As a value, it includes the balance of my physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual health.</p>

        <p>Vibrancy reflects all of the things that make life feel vibrant for me, and includes many of my other "most important" values. Living autonomously, pursuing adventure, acting with courage, exercising creativity, sharing enthusiasm, chasing excellence, enabling others, maintaining close relationships, and partaking in community have all lent themselves to a greater sence of vibrancy in the past. Essentially, this value can be reduced down to the flexible definition of "regularly engaging in the things that I live for" or, really "anything good that exists in opposition of lazy tendencies."</p>

        <p>Personal development could also be grouped within vibrancy, but felt monumental enough to grant its own pyramid. It has always been crucial to my happiness and satisfaction to have challenges I can flex and stretch myself against. The progress of personal development is self-encouraging, and has really been a source of growth for my confidence and self-knowledge over the years.</p>

        <p>"I try to live up to these values."</p>
        <p>Disagree 1 ---- 2 ---- 3 ---- 4 ---- 5 Agree</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Health: 4</li>
          <li>Vibrancy: 5</li>
          <li>Personal Development: 5</li>
        </ul>
        <p>My self-proclaimed foundational value is also the one that I actively try to live up to the least. Unfortunately, it's the first to fall by the wayside when I am stretching myself to follow the other two. Right now I am definitely capitalizing on personal development and vibrancy, but I've not been running and exercising as much as I should be to make sure my life is balanced. When I arrive onsite in two weeks, I'll need to set up a routine that involves exercise and other practices to maintain my health. It would be gainless to compromise my health in pursuit of the other two, since I could then have trouble continuing the program.</p>

        <p>Since I've made very conspicuous life choices following my values in the last year, I've been approached by others who are also contemplating big life choices and their own risks in personal development. Even since I began at Dev Bootcamp, individuals I haven't spoken with in a decade have approached me and asked for advice in chasing their own dreams. It's been a pleasure giving advice in those cases since I so strongly believe in the reasons, values, and the moves themselves; I want to encourage and enable others who are searching for their own passions.</p>

        <p>One nice side affect of giving advice in these cases has been that it reinforces my own satisfaction and strengthens me in the face of ongoing challenges. When I'm feeling down at Dev Bootcamp or under stereotype threat, taking a step back to affirm my values may help me in a similar way by refocusing on the "why" and "what" of all those things that make me happiest, proudest, and most satisfied in life. Shifting my perspective away from the challenge at hand may lift some of the weight of whatever I'm feeling, and act as a good coping mechanism. It's important to have coping mechanisms in place to deal with the pressures of stereotype threat, which can be self-handicapping and limit one's ability to perform at full potential.</p>
