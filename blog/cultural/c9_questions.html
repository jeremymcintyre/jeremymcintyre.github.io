      <h2>How to ask questions The Right Way</h2>
      <div class="serif">
        <h3>6 Dec 2014</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>Asking questions is a huge part of the technical community, so learning how to ask them well is a crucial skill to develop.</p>
        <p>One of the first things to realize about asking questions is the Purpose They Serve.</p>
        <p>A question serves the purpose of soliciting help in getting unstuck with a problem that we have been unable to solve through our own efforts. They do Not serve the purpose of helping us avoid putting effort into solving our own problems.</p>
        <p>So how can we ask a question The Right Way?</p>
        <h4>Try to answer it yourself first</h4>
        <p>This seems obvious, but putting in the time to research and wrestle with a problem is very important for a number of reasons. First, it prevents us from looking like idiots when there is clearly a readily available answer to the question on the internet. Second, it frequently allows us to answer the question ourselves. Third, no one wants to spoonfeed someone who is clearly not putting any effort into getting themselves unstuck.</p>
        <p>Put in the effort, track what resources you looked at, and try to get a feel for how your question is unique.</p>
        <h4>Be specific and concise</h4>
        <p>Provide all relevant information about your problem's environment, what you tried, and why your issue seems different from other questions on the internet. Include only relevant parts of your code, and only include them <span>after</span> you introduce the problem.</p>
        <h4>Proofread</h4>
        <p>Check your grammar, punctuation, spelling, and logic. Does the question make sense? If not, why not?</p>
        <h4>Come up with an engaging and descriptive title</h4>
        <p>The title is the first thing people will read. Do not be vague. Summarize the problem in a short sentence; that's your title. Any extra or complementary descriptors can be included as tags.</p>
        <h4>Respond</h4>
        <p>Thank and respond to anyone who attempts to answer your question. It's only polite.</p>
        <p>And that's really all. For more in depth information, try out the link <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask">here</a> and it's related resources.</p>
        <p>Thanks!</p>
