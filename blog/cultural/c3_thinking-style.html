        <hr>
        <p>Before I officially began at Dev Bootcamp, I was asked to fill out several surveys, one of which was meant to determine my thinking style. This was not some test to see if I had the "right" thinking style, but an exercise in self-awareness. Knowing more about how we think can help us personalize our learning and working strategies.</p>
        <p>As it turns out, my results were somewhere between "concrete random" and "abstract random," with a slightly stronger tendency for concrete random. One thing was sure: the random part.</p>
        <p>The thinking styles that I'm referring to are based on one of two perceptual qualities coupled with one of two ordering abilities. The two perceptual qualities are concrete and abstract; those are the two that I straddle. The ordering abilities are sequential and random, and in their case I most definitely fall into the latter.</p>
        <p>This is by no means a bad thing.</p>
        <p>For one, it means I organize my mind in flexible chunks of information, where order does not matter in terms of how or when they are accessed. Random thinkers consequently tend to connect and see things differently, often arriving at solutions in unique ways, and not always starting at the beginning to do so. </p>
        <p>So how can I use this to my advantage? And what do I need to be aware of?</p>
        <p>Many sources seem to echo the same words when describing concrete random thinkers: instinctive, intuitive, impulsive, risk-taking. Along the same lines, concrete random thinkers are said to have a hard time explaining how they got an answer. This makes sense, because the connections in their brains are often like untraceable phone calls bounced back and forth through many chunks of information. This means that I need to work on explaining and articulating my thinking while working with others, because as a concrete random thinker I tend to operate best in vibrant and competitive environments that permit me to solve problems alone. Interestingly, abstract random thinkers (my second most-prominent thinking style) work best in groups, which is perhaps why I work efficiently alone, but default to conversation when I am around others in a learning environment.</p>
        <p>Just as it is important for concrete random thinkers to use intuition, it is also their strong preference to use trial and error. This applies to both learning and problem solving, often with both happening at the same time. For me, this means that I jump into irb (the interactive Ruby shell) and play around with new methods until I can tease out and internalize their varied applications. Consciously, it also means that I can take this approach more aggressively and deliberately ensure that I form solid chunks of information.</p>
        <p>Other ways I can harness my thinking style are by brainstorming, reattacking problems with new approaches if I have extra time, and interleaving. The last term refers to alternating intense study of one subject with intense study of another, then going back to create more independent and flexible chunks of information.</p>
        <p>Okay, that all got very technical and boring. I discussed my tendencies, and how I can play to my strengths; now it's time to reflect on growth.</p>
        <p>You see, there are two general mindsets: fixed and growth (though they might as well be called closed and open). The former represents the mindset of one who believes their potential and ability are fixed, and cannot increase. This type of mindset is often plagued with the stress of "keeping up appearances," often solely focused on absolute results and uninterested in the journey if it resulted in anything but success. For them, nothing can be gleaned from failure, because their abilities are fixed, so what's the point? </p>
        <p>In glowing contrast, a growth mindset is less concerned by immediate results, and much more interested in the many opportunities they constantly see arising for growth and self improvement. They are consequently much less stressed and more open to learning and, well, growth.</p>
        <p>Do you see where I am going with this? The first part of this reflection was "This Is What I Am." This middle bit is saying something that sounds like "...but growth is always possible!" Mash them together, and you get a perfect segue to this final section.</p>
        <p>The truth is, every thinking style has its own advantages and disadvantages. There's no reason to be just in one camp, and the fact is that few (if any) of us are the complete and utter embodiment of a single thinking style. It's more of a gradient. And so, it's possible to develop strengths that come more naturally to other thinking styles. </p>
        <p>My time at DBC will hold a plethora of chances to do just that. In particular, I think the practice of pseudocoding will help me get better at articulating how I approach and work through a problem. Blogging, sharing knowledge, helping others when they ask (and I'm able), or just discussing and comparing different strategies will also help. Similar to pseudocoding, an additional strategy could be as simple as pausing to think through a problem before diving in to trial-and-error. Yet I expect there will be plenty of unforeseeable ways, as well -- in light of them, I'll just need to remain open and embrace anything that might exercise or expand my ability to learn. After all, our ability to learn is one of the most impactful skills in life.</p>
        <p>On that note, I have a parting question (if you'll allow me to extrapolate from our title). Here it goes: If one person is less intelligent than another, but takes a more active role in learning, how then do the two compare over time?
        <p>What a powerful context; Time. </p>
        <p>Cheers, and thank you very much for reading.</p>
