      <h2>Conflict and the wheel of shame</h2>
      <div class="serif">
        <h3>28 Nov 2014</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>This week's cultural assignment at DBC is to explore the <a href="http://southdown.on.ca/publications/articles/Compass-of-Shame.pdf">compass of shame</a>, which describes common ways people react when faced with conflict. The goal is to see how it pertains to a situation in which we had an emotional conflict with someone.</p>
        <p>One conflict I met was with a coworker at one of my jobs. When I started at the company, the coworker seemed friendly enough &mdash; but as I established myself he decided he didn't like me for some reason, and an interpersonal conflict was born.</p>
        <p>I didn't think of it in terms of "bullying" in the beginning; I had never experienced it before. Honestly, I wasn't sure what to make of it. I did know that it was emotionally troubling and confusing &mdash; it was the first time I had ever felt such obvious disharmony with someone else, and I could think of nothing I had done to instigate it. </p>
        <p>Another coworker confessed that he had received the same inexplicable treatment from this individual, and had never been able to resolve it despite several attempts to meet it. Eventually, he stopped being bothered by it, but suggested that I try bringing it up with the problem individual anyway. I did.</p>
        <p>When I approached the person in private to discover the root of the problem and resolve it, I asked him if I had offended him in any way. What could be done to make it less unpleasant between us? In response, the individual airily denied the existence of any issue.</p>
        <p>It quickly became evident that this person was not interested in acknowledging or resolving his conflict with me, and would not be reasonable to deal with. Still, it made work extremely unpleasant as a result, and I didn't know what to do. I wish I could claim it didn't affect me, but it made me feel like an outsider (remember: I was new to the company), and I began the uncharacteristic behaviors of eating lunch in my cubicle and otherwise avoiding the unpleasant occurrence of crossing paths ("Withdrawal" equates with "North" in the <a href="http://southdown.on.ca/publications/articles/Compass-of-Shame.pdf">compass of shame</a>). This ultimately delayed me from getting to know others who would later become good friends.</p>
        <p>It seemed thin-skinned and premature to go to my boss immediately after perceiving the conflict, and I didn't want to be seen as weak or skittish &mdash; so I began a file instead. Every time this conflict reared it's head, I would document the date and time along with a note about what happened - no adjectives or emotional coloring of the situation; just events, since they spoke for themselves. It only took a few weeks before I had a lengthy file to bring to my boss, so I called a private meeting.</p>
        <p>Meeting with my boss, I instantly felt better. A weight was lifted because I had brought management into the loop about what was going on and discussed a plan to speak up if it began interfering with my work. At the same time, it broke the oppressive atmosphere I had felt at work, and I began socializing with others much more. Meanwhile, my boss was as troubled as I had been, and urged me to give periodic updates so that action could be taken if it continued to be an issue.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately it did continue, although instead of bothering me it became oddly comical. The coworker eventually ceased acknowledging me altogether: refusing to look in my general direction, give any indication that I had spoken when I greeted him &mdash; even going as far as to ignore me when I posed direct questions to him in front of superiors in meetings. It's probably unsurprising that he eventually parted ways with the company, but I learned a lot about dealing with similar issues and felt at peace in how I had approached it: seeking resolution on a private interpersonal level first, then documenting and waiting to see if the problem passed, then ultimately bringing management into it to address the issue once I had established that it was real and persistent.</p>
        <p>The emotional conflict was never resolved in an interpersonal sense, though I attempted to more than once. I don't think I would do anything different if faced with it again.</p>
        <p>Obviously, learning how to deal with conflicts is a lifelong skill, and I think we learn naturally from situations like this. It's unfortunate when they can't be resolved properly, but dealing with them is a reality of life that is good to meet in a thoughtful and proactive way. That is what I tried to do in this situation.</p>
