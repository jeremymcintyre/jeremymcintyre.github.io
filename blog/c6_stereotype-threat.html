      <h2>Stereotype threat: how the pressure of tacit stereotypes can affect our performance</h2>
      <div class="serif">
        <h3>15 Nov 2014</h3>
        <hr>

        <p>I was at a wedding reception recently, and had forgotten my wallet. There I was in my suit, a 26-year old man with the face of a 19-year old, and nervous about walking up to the bar. Given how frequently I'm mistaken for a younger age bracket, the nerves seemed well-founded. My brother-in-law assured me that no one gets carded at a wedding, and I tried to shrug it off, but the threat of imminent humiliation hung over me. It's comical now, but it was really uncomfortable in the moment &mdash; I felt like I was trying to hide something, and if I got carded I would be singled out and exposed with nothing to clear my name.</p>

        <p>I was so caught up in not appearing to be underrage that I'm quite sure I gave an Oscar-worthy performance of an underrage kid walking up to a bar and trying to act cool &mdash; right down to the stomach butterflies I was actually experiencing, Daniel Day-Lewis style. The bartender no doubt picked up on it, but not in a talent-recruitment capacity; he asked me curtly for my ID, at which point I froze just like an underrage kid, said I didn't have it, and was turned away in disgust. (For the sake of completeness: I was able to have an officer verify my age and license over the phone, and after that the barstaff became the picture of attentive service for the rest of the night.)</p>

        <p>Maybe he would have carded me anyway; maybe he wouldn't. The bottom line is that I felt at risk of verifying a stereotype that I understood might be applied to me, and it directly impacted my "performance." Regardless of outcome, my ability to act natural would never have been called into question if I had believed that I looked my own age, known I could provide my ID, or even mistakenly believed that I had it with me.</p>

        <p>What I just described is one benign but illustrative example of "stereotype threat," the research focus of our cultural assignment at Dev Bootcamp this week.</p>

        <p>Stereotype threat is a fascinating concept that gives a name to a phenomenon that many or all of us have felt before. It occurs when we perceive that a negative stereotype exists regarding a group that we identify with, and that our performance in the current context is at risk of fulfilling or confirming that negative stereotype. In this sense, it is a unique psychological pressure that is separate and "in addition" to the inherent pressures of a given situation.</p>

        <p>Before I launch into examples that aren't mine, let me first introduce Claude M. Steele, whose work I will be referencing. Steele coined the phrase "stereotype threat" back in 1995, and is responsible for much of what we now know on the topic. My own research primarily involved watching this phenomenal lecture he gave at Columbia University, which I highly recommend &mdash; he is a captivating speaker and the work is very interesting:</p>

        <iframe width="420" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/q1fzIuuXlkk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

        <p>I mentioned before that stereotype threat is a unique pressure in addition to any innate pressures of a given situation. For example, in his lecture, Steele explains an experiment in which male and female students invested in math disciplines were given an advanced math test. Each participant took the test alone in a room. The test was very difficult, so obviously there were inherent pressures in the situation for all participants. However, it was predicted that females would be under the additional stress and distraction of knowing that a poor performance could support the group stereotype that women are not as good at math as men. By comparison, men were taking the same difficult test but were "not at risk of confirming anything like a group-based limitation of ability." Women did indeed perform poorly on the test compared to men, but when the experiment was repeated under conditions that removed the stereotype threat &mdash; by explicitly telling participants that women always perform just as well as men on that specific test &mdash; then women and men performed equivalently.</p>

        <p>For the sake of brevity, I will not discuss the many other experiments he references, but recommend watching the video or doing further research on the now large body of work confirming the reality of stereotype threat.</p>

        <p>While reflecting, I found that I've experienced stereotype threat due to age, perceived age, religious affiliation, nationality (while traveling), race (as Steele points out, sometimes white men are more susceptible to being judged as racist), even body type. I can attest that it is a distraction and often interferes with performance when present, no matter if the performance is physical, cognitive, or behavioral. Please take note that I am not complaining or insinuating that my lot in life is particularly difficult. Instead, I merely aim to demonstrate that stereotype threat can affect anyone, and probably does, whether or not we subjectively pick up on it.</p>

        <p>And, because it can affect performance, it holds a business relevance as well.</p>

        <p>Perhaps some of us will experience stereotype threat when we graduate from Dev Bootcamp. Maybe we will feel at risk of confirming stereotypes about bootcamp graduates as compared with traditional CS majors. As such, it will be personally important for us to be aware of stereotype threat and how to offset it when possible.</p>

        <p>For me, it will be a concept I carry with me into the workforce. Now that I know about it, I think it will be difficult to not consider how its presence can affect others or myself. My layman's interpretation of Steele's findings is that reducing stereotype threat can be as simple as verbally acknowledging and dismissing stereotypes. We are naturally and acutely aware of when unspoken stereotypes might come into play, so denying them their power could be as simple as explaining that we don't buy into them and won't expect others' work to reflect them.</p>

        <p>Someday I will be in managerial role, and this will be a very important issue to stay on top of as a manager. Steele's findings show that stereotype threat can and does lead to underperformance and self-handicapping. Seeing as any manager wants their team's performance to reflect their full capabilities, rooting out any factors that undermine performance will be crucial. Even before that, it will important to analyze situations and make sure my teammates are not being affected.</p>

        <p>That brings us to the end of this reflection! Before this gets any longer I will thank you for reading, and hope you found it interesting enough to do some further research.</p>
