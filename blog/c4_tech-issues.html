      <h2>Issues in Tech: An unfair state of affairs for women and minorities</h2>
      <div class="serif">
        <h3>2 Nov 2014</h3>
        <hr>

        <p>It's sad, really. There is so much evidence supporting the fact that <a href="http://www.catalyst.org/media/catalysts-global-report-uncovers-new-layers-inequity-women-stem-industries">women are at an unfair disadvantage in tech</a> that it is ineffectual and feeble to contradict it.</p>

        <p>Many others cite reasons why the tech industry would benefit from having a higher representation of women and minorities in both technical and nontechnical roles. For example, one <a href="http://www.catalyst.org/media/companies-more-women-board-directors-experience-higher-financial-performance-according-latest">Catalyst study</a> found that Fortune 500 companies with more women board directors financially outperformed companies with fewer women in those roles. Other articles and studies reference <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-diversity-makes-us-smarter/">boosted innovation and many other benefits correlated with diversity</a>. While information like this is helpful and powerful, my position is somewhat simpler:</p>

        <p>Women and minorities should be treated fairly regardless of whether or not the tech industry would benefit in any "special ways" from their fair inclusion. Industries benefit from employing talented people; that is enough. If someone is good at their job, they should get compensated fairly and on a level that doesn't factor in their sex or any other subjective factor. By extension, they should have access to the same employment and advancement opportunities given their performance against an objective standard. Further, they should not be harassed or made to feel like an outsider under any circumstances, as anti-harassment legislation already recognizes this to be unacceptable.</p>

        <p>I would note that while it's far cleaner and more convenient to list out a bunch of "shoulds" than enforce them in practice, this type of list is important when identifying what needs to be done to improve the current state of affairs.</p>

        <p>I have only been on Twitter for about a month now, and the amount of activity I have seen regarding the treatment of women in tech has been staggering. Such harrassment is inexcusable and disturbing. (To be fair, the responses of people advocating fair treatment of women have in rare cases been equally radical and oddly similar to the attacks of those they are rebutting. I would discourage this as well, since that sort of symmetry is often hypocritical and rarely productive. An equal-but-opposite evil is still an evil, and wildly targeting men in a reactionary way is not an answer.)</p>

        <p>Of course, the most visible signs of any dispute are always the loudest ones. Online bullying and bigotry might grab our attention, but the big picture involves a great deal more subtlety than what is readily searchable or apparent.</p>

        <p>Companies like Google have started to recognize and train people on <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/25/technology/exposing-hidden-biases-at-google-to-improve-diversity.html?_r=0">what are referred to as "hidden biases,"</a> which can be described as unconscious (rather than purposeful) manifestations of sexism or other bias. For example, say I interview a woman and a man for a role. Perhaps I unconsciously relate better to a fellow man, so I end up giving him the job even though the woman was slightly better qualified. In this hypothetical situation, I do this because I am subconsciously more comfortable with that decision. It seems impossible to train that sort of bias out of existence, but awareness of hidden biases might help us to remember to evaluate professionals more objectively and lead to increased diversity.</p>

        <p>Facebook has also recognized another part of the problem, which is at the level of <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffbercovici/2014/07/03/how-facebook-is-trying-to-fix-its-diversity-problem-and-the-whole-tech-industrys/">training and skills acquisition.</a> If women and minorities don't have equal access to training, then fewer will even try to enter the tech industry, let alone have the opportunity to be treated justly once in it. As a result, Facebook is trying to make access to tech skills and training more ubiquitous. Changing the industry pie chart will take time, but more programs like this can help encourage a growing diversity in the pool of incoming talent.</p>

        <p>Beyond these efforts, it will be up to those already in the industry to begin making changes. Starting men and women at the same level of pay seems like a straightforward place to begin. Defining clear, objective performance standards on a per-company or even per-team basis will also help. Ensuring that functional systems are a) in place, and b) properly enforced to protect against bullying or other hostile behavior is another tricky (but essential) area that cannot be neglected if we are to change this.</p>

        <p>I imagine there is some sort of cultural inertia that will resist change up to a certain tipping point, but after we overcome that I suspect the new diversity will become naturally self-sustaining. I look forward to that day, and I think the industry should as well.</p>

        <p>Cheers.</p>
