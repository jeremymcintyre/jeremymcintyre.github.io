      <h2>Here's the Kitchen: Make yourselves at Home</h2>

        <h3>10 Oct 2014</h3>
        <hr>

        <p>Just watched the Fireside Chat video with Shereef. He talked about the entitlement and expectation of a restaurant mentality versus the curiousity and creativity of the kitchen mindset. This reinforced what I already figured was the truth: the whole thing is an experiment, and we're on the same team as the chefs. In fact, we're cooks! What are we making? The most awesome grab-it-by-the-horns educational experience we can put together. It will involve teamwork, open minds, ownership of our own learning, creativity, and as much effort as we can muster. The more we share and promote each other, the more the whole group will be uplifted to new heights of capability and enthusiasm. We have the advantage of being a relatively small group of people in a relatively flexible, fresh and experimental curriculum, which means that the more we pour ourselves into this experience, the more we will get out of it. I cannot wait to dive in and see what we can make!</p>

        <p>Shereef also touched on a subtle topic that I'd picked up on: breadth over depth. There is a balance, as Shereef said, and I think one of the tricky parts of the program will be figuring out when to go deeper versus when to go for a wider knowledge base.</p>

        <p>The last thing I'd like to reflect on is when Shereef discussed and dethroned popular fears. It was helpful. Sounds like I have the right idea about it, though: I believe in myself but am also really nervous because I know this will be the most challenging experience I have ever gone through. I can't expect it to be "got accepted + attended = job." The reality is that I don't expect to be the best, but I know I will put in everything I have. One of the reasons I chose DBC in the first place was because they so obviously believe in students simply for being willing to do just that. DBC values drive over sheer intelligence, and already believes we're smart enough to succeed in the program. That's really cool, really powerful, and really encouraging. This experience will not be easy, nor will it see itself through - it will take tons of effort and energy. But I am really excited for the culture, the unique balance, and the sprint of this special educational living experience.</p>
