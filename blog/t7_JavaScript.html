      <h2>Ruby hashes and JavaScript objects: how similar are they?</h2>
      <div class="serif">
        <h3>23 Nov 2014</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>This week I began learning JavaScript, and I must say I like it a lot. It feels very different from Ruby, but also familiar. There are plenty of functional and syntactical contrasts to be made, but then there are elements that even look somewhat similar at first glance. One example of this is in the comparison between Ruby hashes and JavaScript objects.</p>
        <p>In a lot of ways, they are pretty similar. Take a gander:</p>
        <pre class="ruby"><code>
  my_hash = {penguins: 42, porpoises: 12}
  => {:penguins => 42, :porpoises => 12}
        </code></pre>
        <pre class="js"><code>
  myObject = {penguins: 42, porpoises: 12};
  > {penguins: 42, porpoises: 12}
        </code></pre>
        <p>Both of them are unordered dictionary-like structures with associated pairs, the first of each pointing to the second; both are also objects; and, both allow their values to be changed. However, there are also a number of differing features between the two.</p>
        <p>Before diving into syntax differences, let's explore "how to talk about them." In Ruby hashes, the first part of each pair is called a "key." This would be similar to the name of the "property" in a JavaScript object.</p>
        <pre class="ruby"><code>
  {key1 => value1, key2 => value2}
        </code></pre>
        <pre class="js"><code>
  {property1: value1, property2: value2}
        </code></pre>
        <p>Keys point to "values" in hashes, which can be anything from Boolean values to Fixnums, Floats, Strings, Arrays or other Hashes. A JavaScipt object's properties can similarly store numbers, arrays, Boolean values, other objects, or even functions. Storing methods (equated with functions) in hashes is unsuccessful, because Ruby tries to evaluate the method and then store what's returned:</p>
        <pre class="ruby"><code>
  def hello_from_hash
    "Hi"
  end

  hash = {my_method: hello_from_hash}
  => {my_method: "Hi"}
        </code></pre>
        <p>...whereas properties can store functions and use them in a way syntactically and functionally reminiscent of calling a method on a Ruby object:</p>
        <pre class="js"><code>
  var myObj = {};
  myObj.hello = function() {
    console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
  }

  myObj.hello("dear Reader")
  > "Hello, dear Reader!"
        </code></pre>
        <p>Accessing and changing values of keys and properties is also similar. Square brackets can be used in both cases to either add new keys/properties, or to change the values of existing ones.</p>
        <pre class="ruby"><code>
  favorites = {:food => "sushi"}

  favorites[:dessert] = "tiramisu"
  => {:food => "sushi", :dessert => "tiramisu"}

  favorites[:food] = "cheeseburger"
  => {:food => "cheeseburger", :dessert => "tiramisu"}
        </code></pre>
        <pre class="js"><code>
  var favorites = {food: "sushi"};

  favorites["dessert"] = "tiramisu";
  > {food: "sushi", dessert: "tiramisu"}

  favorites["food"] = "cheeseburger";
  > {food: "cheeseburger", dessert: "tiramisu"}
        </code></pre>
        <p>However, one of the differences is that properties can be accessed or created directly using dot syntax. In the previous example, it would probably be more common to use the following syntax:</p>
        <pre class="js"><code>
  var favorites = {food: "sushi"};

  favorites.dessert = "tiramisu";
  > {food: "sushi", dessert: "tiramisu"}
        </code></pre>
        <p>At the end of this week, the last and biggest difference for me is that hashes can associate key and value pairs of any two types of Ruby objects (even classes), whereas a property can only store one type of object that is accessed by its name. For example, a hash could consist of hashes as keys pointing to values that are also hashes &mdash; it would be ugly, but it could happen. As far as I can tell, there is no equivalent ability of functionality in JavaScript object properties, just like there is no ability to store a functioning method as a value in a hash.</p>

        <p>There are many other intriguing differences between the two languages that I've come across, but they are beyong the scope of this simple reflection. I hope this introductory comparison of Ruby hashes and JavaScript objects was helpful or interesting, and as always, thanks for reading!</p>
