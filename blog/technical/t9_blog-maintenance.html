      <h2>The good and the bad of site maintenance</h2>
      <div class="serif">
        <h3>7 Dec 2014</h3>
        <hr>

        <p>Having a site is pretty cool. Maintaining it is also pretty cool &mdash; but it definitely requires a maintenance schedule so that time is actually allocated for this task.</p>
        <p>As it stands, I'm reasonably happy with my site. <span>Reasonably</span> happy. Every time I update something, I notice something else that I want to change. Right now, I still want to add jQuery scripts to make smoother scrolling between anchor tags (rather than quick jumps), continue to update the actual text I have written, and decide on the future of my responsive design: do I stay strictly with css, or use a framework?</p>
        <p>The biggest things that were bugging me before this most recent update were the text on my <span>index.html</span> page and the plain-looking text on my main landing page. In order to scratch these itches, I updated the content, added support for italics in my fonts, and chose a better color for <code>span</code> elements on the main page. I also modified the "about" page and altered the tone of the contact page to reflect something more professional and complete &mdash; but I still don't feel they are finished.</p>
        <p>That's why maintenance is so important. My site will only get better &mdash; and I will only continue to learn through it &mdash; if I continue to make changes and review the code.</p>
        <p>In conjunction with maintenance, I realize it's very important to do your research &mdash; ask for feedback, analyze the feedback, and make changes based on what people want to see. This site is not all about me, though it should reflect who I am; it is also about catering to the audience and making sure it accomplishes what I intend to accomplish with it. Is it professional? Is it convincing? Does it showcase my skills and best traits? Or, are parts of it annoying? These are all questions to routinely ask myself and others at various points in the maintenance schedule.</p>
        <p>I also received the feedback that it would be cool to deploy my site on my own personal domain. This would be cool, and I intend to look into it, but I don't want to until I have done further maintenance on it.</p>
        <p>It's been challenging sticking to my maintenance schedule, and has become more challenging to implement new design features as the number of pages needing to be changed has increased. However, I have liked the feeling of making small continual improvements over time, and I think that is the important philosophy for me to stick to in the future.</p>
