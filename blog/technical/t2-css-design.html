        <p>Imagine looking at a magazine article. In your mind's eye, consider all the components of the article - there are titles, subtitles, paragraphs of text, perhaps isolated boxes of text highlighting some key concepts regarding the article. That's like the HTML of a website - it's the structure; the "what" as in "what's on the page?"</p>
        <p>Now consider all the little design decisions that needed to be made to get the magazine article looking so nice and professional - the margins, the colors, the sizes of different kinds of text, the placement of each structural component. That's like the CSS - it targets different objects in the HTML (for our sake, the magazine article) and tells them where to go and what to look like.</p>
        <p>Let's drive this point home: if all you had were the unformatted components of the magazine article, it would be like having just the HTML of a webpage. </p>
        <p>Now, how would you tell the different pieces where to go and what to look like? Well, I suppose you would call them out by name. "Hey, Title, go near the top of the page - a little left...perfect." This would be the equivalent of using the HTML &lttitle&gt tag as a selector, so that your CSS would know where to apply your directions.</p>
        <p>In other words, you use the tags built into the HTML to select the content and change how it displays with CSS. In HTML, tags generally bookend content such as this: &lttitle&gtThis is the title&lt/title&gt. As you can see, there is an opening and a closing tag, and the content is in between. So if you wanted to make the title bigger, you would select it with the title tag, and then apply CSS to the tag.</p>
        <p>The same would be true for paragraphs, so if you wanted to format paragraphs a certain way, you could select the HTML tag for paragraphs, &ltp&gt, and then apply your CSS to tell them how to look.</p>
        <p>However, let's say you have a standalone box on the magazine page that is formatted differently than the rest of the article. It has a paragraph in it, but you want it to look different than the other paragraphs. This would be a good case to use an ID, because there is only one of those standalone boxes, and you will only need to use the styling rules in that one case.</p>
        <p>We'll get back to IDs in a second, but first let's introduce classes as well. While IDs are perfect when you only have one instance of something, classes are great when you want to reuse similar styling for other components. For example, if you consider not just the magazine article but the entire magazine, chances are you'd have some styling rules that you'd want to reuse. Maybe you would want the main body paragraphs of all articles to look more or less the same, so you could create a set of CSS rules for that class. Then, every time you wanted those rules to be applied to a new article, you could just add the class name to the appropriate content and it would be applied!</p>
        <p>This might be getting a little confusing, so let's take a look at what tags, ids, and classes look like in the HTML file:</p>
        <p><img src="t2-css-design/t2-screen1.png" alt=""></p>
        <p>At this point, I think we can mostly shed our magazine metaphor, though we might keep it handy in the future. However, let's dive into some of the web-based advantages and good practices of using classes versus IDs, now that we have an idea of what they are and why they might be used.</p>
        <p>(Just in case you're still sorting it out, let me summarize up this point: classes and IDs are ways to specify and select specific content from an HTML structure.)</p>
        <p>If classes and IDs both select content in an HTML document, and there are also existing generic HTML tags like '&lttitle&gt' and '&ltp&gt' that can select content in an HTML document, how are they all different? The answer can be summed up mostly in one word: specificity.</p>
        <p>Generic HTML tags are really generic. Classes are made by you, so they can be more specific. IDs are the most specific, because each one can only refer to one place in the HTML document. Therefore, there are particular uses that are better suited to classes, and some better suited to IDs.</p>
        <p>Not every HTML element needs to be assigned a class or an ID. On the other hand, it is not exclusive that an item with a class or multiple classes cannot also have an ID; they can have both. But as we said, if there is a particular element that will have unique styling, then an ID is appropriate. Further, because IDs can be used in links, they can be more appropriate for titles, headers, or other places that a user might link to from another place. However, if a set of CSS rules might be applicable in more than one place, then it is best to assign a class instead. </p>
        <p>You may have picked it up, but I mentioned in the previous paragraph that an element can have more than one class. This is really cool, and can make styling much more specific and modular. Consider the CSS rules below.</p>
        <img src="t2-css-design/t2-screen2.png" alt="">
        <p>Elements with a class of "awesome" will have a width set at 100 pixels. Items with a class of "box" will be set with a height of 200 pixels, while elements tagged with both classes will additionally have their background color set to red.</p>
        <p>It is possible, but apparently inefficient to use tags preceding IDs or classes. For example, look at this:</p>
        <img src="t2-css-design/t2-screen3.png" alt="">
        <p>The first example says "paragraphs with a class of awesome should have a width of 100px." When possible, it is faster for the browser if the HTML is structured so that this sort of specification is implied, and can be left out. It is better to have rules that look like the second example for classes, or the fourth example for IDs. The last example is okay, though - it targets the specific element with a "better" ID, and then selects the paragraphs within that element.</p>
        <p>So now we know that elements can have more than one class, and they can have an ID in combination with a class or classes, and finally that we can utilize these selectors to create very specific rules in our CSS. Classes can help these rules be applied in distinct cases, while IDs are perfect for unique styling situations, or to mark an element as a destination for a hyperlink. We also know a bit about how Not to use classes and IDs, and can think about when it might be appropriate to use each.</p>
        <p>I hope this was clear and helpful - thank you for reading!</p>
