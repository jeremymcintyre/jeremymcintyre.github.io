        <p>I'm going to come right out and say something, and I don't expect there to be any confused looks in the room: computers need ways to organize stuff.</p>
        <p>The fact is: Computers deal with so much information, if it wasn't organized somehow, it would be absolutely unmanageable. By the same token, computer languages need to have effective ways of organizing, handling and describing how information is grouped. (Programmers need ways of organizing information, too, otherwise they'd go crazy.)</p>
        <p>Ruby--the wonderfully flexible, easy-to-read language that I have been learning about all summer--has some pretty standard, good ways of organizing information. The title, of course, has already given them away<a href="http://jeremymcintyre.github.io/blog/t3_arrays-hashes.html">...more</a></p>

        <p>Before I officially began at Dev Bootcamp, I was asked to fill out several surveys, one of which was meant to determine my thinking style. This was not some test to see if I had the "right" thinking style, but an exercise in self-awareness. Knowing more about how we think can help us personalize our learning and working strategies.</p>
        <p>As it turns out, my results were somewhere between "concrete random" and "abstract random," with a slightly stronger tendency for concrete random. One thing was sure: the random part.</p>
        <p>The thinking styles that I'm referring to are based on one of two perceptual qualities coupled with<a href="http://jeremymcintyre.github.io/blog/c3_thinking-style.html">...more</a></p>

        <p>Imagine looking at a magazine article. In your mind's eye, consider all the components of the article - there are titles, subtitles, paragraphs of text, perhaps isolated boxes of text highlighting some key concepts regarding the article. That's like the HTML of a website - it's the structure; the "what" as in "what's on the page?"</p>
        <p>Now consider all the little design decisions that needed to be made to get the magazine article looking so nice and professional - the margins, the colors, the sizes of different kinds of text, the placement of each structural component. That's like the CSS - it targets different objects in the HTML (for our sake, the magazine article) and tells them where to go and what to look like.</p>
        <p>Let's drive this point home: if all you had were the unformatted components of the<a href="http://jeremymcintyre.github.io/blog/t2-css-design.html">...more</a></p>

        <p>Just watched the Fireside Chat video with Shereef. He talked about the entitlement and expectation of a restaurant mentality versus the curiousity and creativity of the kitchen mindset. This reinforced what I already figured was the truth: the whole thing is an experiment, and we're on the same team as the chefs. In fact, we're cooks! What are we making? The most awesome grab-it-by-the-horns educational experience we can put together. It will involve teamwork, open minds, ownership of our own learning, creativity, and as much effort as we can muster. The more we share and promote each other, the more the whole group will be uplifted to new heights of capability and enthusiasm. We have the advantage of being<a href="http://jeremymcintyre.github.io/blog/c1-chefs-kitchen.html">...more</a></p>

        <p>Git is awesome. As a newb, I think the most important place to start is there.  You'll like learning about it. It's clever, it's helpful, and it has a super-cool online friend that goes by the name of GitHub. More on their friendship in a bit.</p>
        <p>"Why," you ask, "is git so awesome? What is it?"</p>
        <p>Git is a piece of software that does version control. It tracks and keeps a nice, orderly history of all the changes made to a project over time. That history is navigable, so you can go back to earlier versions if stuff goes haywire -- or if you just want to figure out why a particular change was made. It also protects against total loss of a project, because there is always the nice string of previous versions to fall back on.  <a href="http://jeremymcintyre.github.io/blog/t1-git-blog.html">...more</a></p>
