        <p>You are designing an application. You opt for one of two scenarios. In the first, code is repeated and logic duplicated when and where it's needed. There is some reuse of code, but it's random. In the second, each piece of knowledge is written only once, and then implemented from its source.</p>
        <p>You choose the second.</p>
        <p>Why do you choose the second? Because it is smarter. When you need to change, update, or extend your code in the future, this means you only have to make changes to each relevant piece of logic in one spot, rather than hunting it down and changing it all over the place &mdash; fewer bugs, less maintenance. It also makes your code more modular ("Cool! I can reuse that over here...") and more orthogonal ("When I change something over here, nothing else breaks.") This concept is essentially what Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas popularized under the D.R.Y. acronym &mdash; "Don't Repeat Yourself."<a href="http://jeremymcintyre.github.io/blog/t6_oop-concepts.html">...more</a></p>

        <p>I was at a wedding reception recently, and had forgotten my wallet. There I was in my suit, a 26-year old man with the face of a 19-year old, and nervous about walking up to the bar. Given how frequently I'm mistaken for a younger age bracket, the nerves seemed well-founded. My brother-in-law assured me that no one gets carded at a wedding, and I tried to shrug it off, but the threat of imminent humiliation hung over me. It's comical now, but it was really uncomfortable in the moment &mdash; I felt like I was trying to hide something, and if I got carded I would be singled out and exposed with nothing to clear my name.</p>
        <p>I was so caught up in not appearing to be underrage that I'm quite sure I gave an Oscar-worthy performance of an underrage kid walking up to a bar and trying to act cool<a href="http://jeremymcintyre.github.io/blog/c6_stereotype-threat.html">...more</a></p>

        <p>When I was in Guatemala, I got my open water SCUBA certification in a volcanic lake at relatively high altitude. Among other things, this meant that it was much more difficult to control my bouyancy than it would have been at sea level. Controlling one's bouyancy is a skill intimately tied to safety in SCUBA (probably the most important one after "never stop breathing!") and is also a good indicator of one's level of expertise. In any case, by the time I did my first ocean dive, my bouyancy control still needed polishing...but it was also leaps ahead of where it should have been, according to my instructor. Learning in the lake wasn't glamorous, and it felt a bit awkward at times - but my skill was much more fine-tuned than it would have been if I had learned at sea level, where conditions are more forgiving.</p>
        <p>Pair programming during Phase 0 feels a bit like learning to dive at altitude.<a href="http://jeremymcintyre.github.io/blog/c5_feedback.html">...more</a></p>

        <h3>6 Nov 2014</h3>
        <p>This week at Dev Bootcamp we started playing with Ruby classes. This is very exciting, and I'll tell you why:</p>
        <p>Classes are an exceptionally vital part of Ruby as an object-oriented language. Just like in the real-world, almost everything in Ruby is an object -- it has certain traits or abilities, and can be classified according to what it is and how it behaves. In fact, every object in Ruby is an instance of a class. This makes it super useful for modeling real-world things, because it means we can organize objects and their abilities according to how they are organized in real life.</p>
        <p>For example, a Northern Harrier is a hawk, which is a bird, which is a type of animal.<a href="http://jeremymcintyre.github.io/blog/t5_ruby-classes.html">...more</a></p>

        <h3>2 Nov 2014</h3>
        <p>It's sad, really. There is so much evidence supporting the fact that women are at an unfair disadvantage in tech that it is ineffectual and feeble to contradict it.</p>
        <p>Many others cite reasons why the tech industry would benefit from having a higher representation of women and minorities in both technical and nontechnical roles. For example, one Catalyst study found that Fortune 500 companies with more women board directors financially outperformed companies with fewer women in those roles. Other articles and studies reference boosted innovation and many other benefits correlated with diversity. While information like this is helpful and powerful, my position is somewhat simpler<a href="http://jeremymcintyre.github.io/blog/c4_tech-issues.html">...more</a></p>

      <div class="serif">
        <h3>31 Oct 2014</h3>
        <p>Methods in Ruby are grouped by class or module. One particularly useful module is called <code>Enumerable</code>, which provides all sorts of iterative and sorting capabilities. Many of the methods we use on arrays and hashes come from the <code>Enumerable</code> module.</p>
        <p>In this reflection, it was my job to research an <code>Enumerable</code> method and present it to you, the reader. So at this point we are going to take a little dive into the method <code>#group_by.</code></p>
        <p>Ruby once again succeeds at readability, as I'm sure without even saying anything that you have some notion of what the method does: it groups things according to<a href="http://jeremymcintyre.github.io/blog/t4_enumerable-methods.html">...more</a></p>

        <p>I'm going to come right out and say something, and I don't expect there to be any confused looks in the room: computers need ways to organize stuff.</p>
        <p>The fact is: Computers deal with so much information, if it wasn't organized somehow, it would be absolutely unmanageable. By the same token, computer languages need to have effective ways of organizing, handling and describing how information is grouped. (Programmers need ways of organizing information, too, otherwise they'd go crazy.)</p>
        <p>Ruby--the wonderfully flexible, easy-to-read language that I have been learning about all summer--has some pretty standard, good ways of organizing information. The title, of course, has already given them away<a href="http://jeremymcintyre.github.io/blog/t3_arrays-hashes.html">...more</a></p>

        <h3>21 Oct 2014</h3>
        <p>Before I officially began at Dev Bootcamp, I was asked to fill out several surveys, one of which was meant to determine my thinking style. This was not some test to see if I had the "right" thinking style, but an exercise in self-awareness. Knowing more about how we think can help us personalize our learning and working strategies.</p>
        <p>As it turns out, my results were somewhere between "concrete random" and "abstract random," with a slightly stronger tendency for concrete random. One thing was sure: the random part.</p>
        <p>The thinking styles that I'm referring to are based on one of two perceptual qualities coupled with<a href="http://jeremymcintyre.github.io/blog/c3_thinking-style.html">...more</a></p>

        <h3>19 Oct 2014</h3>
        <p>Imagine looking at a magazine article. In your mind's eye, consider all the components of the article - there are titles, subtitles, paragraphs of text, perhaps isolated boxes of text highlighting some key concepts regarding the article. That's like the HTML of a website - it's the structure; the "what" as in "what's on the page?"</p>
        <p>Now consider all the little design decisions that needed to be made to get the magazine article looking so nice and professional - the margins, the colors, the sizes of different kinds of text, the placement of each structural component. That's like the CSS - it targets different objects in the HTML (for our sake, the magazine article) and tells them where to go and what to look like.</p>
        <p>Let's drive this point home: if all you had were the unformatted components of the<a href="http://jeremymcintyre.github.io/blog/t2-css-design.html">...more</a></p>

        <p>Just watched the Fireside Chat video with Shereef. He talked about the entitlement and expectation of a restaurant mentality versus the curiousity and creativity of the kitchen mindset. This reinforced what I already figured was the truth: the whole thing is an experiment, and we're on the same team as the chefs. In fact, we're cooks! What are we making? The most awesome grab-it-by-the-horns educational experience we can put together. It will involve teamwork, open minds, ownership of our own learning, creativity, and as much effort as we can muster. The more we share and promote each other, the more the whole group will be uplifted to new heights of capability and enthusiasm.

        <p>Git is awesome. As a newb, I think the most important place to start is there.  You'll like learning about it. It's clever, it's helpful, and it has a super-cool online friend that goes by the name of GitHub. More on their friendship in a bit.</p>
        <p>"Why," you ask, "is git so awesome? What is it?"</p>
        <p>Git is a piece of software that does version control. It tracks and keeps a nice, orderly history of all the changes made to a project over time. That history is navigable, so you can go back to earlier versions if stuff goes haywire -- or if you just want to figure out why a particular change was made. It also protects against total loss of a project, because there is always the nice string of previous versions to fall back on.  <a href="http://jeremymcintyre.github.io/blog/t1-git-blog.html">...more</a></p>
