# Jeremy McIntyre

This is my first [personal website](http://jeremymcintyre.github.io/blog/ "Jeremy McIntyre's personal site"). I designed it before attending the onsite portion of Dev Bootcamp's 19-week intensive training program for aspiring web developers, and have been returning to update it from time to time.

Most projects completed at Dev Bootcamp are in private repos, but this personal site (and my GitHub page) will increasingly feature new publicly visible projects as I build them!
